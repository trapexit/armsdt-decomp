# Workflow status matrix

This file is the concise repository-visible snapshot of tool and step readiness.

Status vocabulary: `confirmed`, `open`, `blocked`.

## Baseline snapshot

| Tool | Step 1 core outputs (`Makefile`, `src/`, `tests/`) | Step 1 build (`recompiled/build/<tool>`) | Step 2 spec (`technical_specification.md`) | Step 3 core outputs (`Makefile`, `src/`, `tests/`) | Step 3 build (`recreated/build/<tool>`) | Primary blocker/notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `armlib` | confirmed | blocked | open | open | open | Step 1 compile-triage advanced: startup wrapper was progressed by adding a concrete `main` shim that dispatches to `FUN_0804a988`, and `rtk make` now emits `recompiled/build/armlib`. Runtime parity is still blocked because candidate startup hangs: `../../armlib/armlib` returns no-args exit 1 quickly, but `./build/armlib` times out under a 2s probe and `make test` terminates. Closure experiment: migrate `FUN_0804a988` argc/argv entry typing and traversal (`undefined4 *`/32-bit stepping) to pointer-width-safe argv handling so startup returns and CLI parity tests can run to completion. |
| `decaof` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armlink` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armasm` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armcc` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armcpp` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |

## Current readiness highlights

1. Highest-priority actionable item remains step 1 completion for `armlib`.
2. `armlib` step 1 core outputs remain present (`recompiled/Makefile`, `recompiled/src/`, `recompiled/tests/`), and compile triage is active with link-stage startup recovery completed for this batch but runtime startup/argv typing still blocked before two-way CLI parity can pass.
3. Step 1 remains the active phase across all tools; step 2 and step 3 are not ready for any tool.

## Update rules

1. Update this file whenever a tool-step readiness state changes.
2. Use only `confirmed`, `open`, and `blocked`.
3. Keep blockers concrete and include the next closure experiment in touched step artifacts.
