# Workflow status matrix

This file is the concise repository-visible snapshot of tool and step readiness.

Status vocabulary: `confirmed`, `open`, `blocked`.

## Baseline snapshot

| Tool | Step 1 core outputs (`Makefile`, `src/`, `tests/`) | Step 1 build (`recompiled/build/<tool>`) | Step 2 spec (`technical_specification.md`) | Step 3 core outputs (`Makefile`, `src/`, `tests/`) | Step 3 build (`recreated/build/<tool>`) | Primary blocker/notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `armlib` | confirmed | blocked | open | open | open | Step 1 compile-triage advanced: duplicate DAT redefinitions and early prototype blockers were reduced, but build is still blocked by remaining C90/decompiler artifacts (`//` warning blocks and `_0_1_` pseudo-field usage in `FUN_0804acd0`). Closure experiment: normalize remaining `//` lines to C comments and replace pseudo-field writes with explicit byte operations, then rebuild and run two-way CLI parity tests. |
| `decaof` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armlink` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armasm` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armcc` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |
| `armcpp` | open | open | open | open | open | Step outputs not started |

## Current readiness highlights

1. Highest-priority actionable item remains step 1 completion for `armlib`.
2. `armlib` step 1 core outputs remain present (`recompiled/Makefile`, `recompiled/src/`, `recompiled/tests/`), and compile triage is active with a narrowed blocker set before first successful `recompiled/build/armlib` output.
3. Step 1 remains the active phase across all tools; step 2 and step 3 are not ready for any tool.

## Update rules

1. Update this file whenever a tool-step readiness state changes.
2. Use only `confirmed`, `open`, and `blocked`.
3. Keep blockers concrete and include the next closure experiment in touched step artifacts.
